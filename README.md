# Introductory Materials

Welcome to the Center for New Data's introductory materials repository. If you are unfamiliar with the Center for New Data, check out our <a href = "https://www.newdata.org/"> website </a> and follow us on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/center4newdata"> Twitter </a>!

## About Us

We are an all-volunteer, non-profit organization originally convened at the start of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic as the COVID Alliance. Our volunteers span technologists, policy researchers, and entrepreneurs. In the past year, the Center for New Data stood up an end-to-end data, insights, and research platform -- designed to ingest complex, sensitive data; protecting it with state-of-the-art privacy controls. Volunteers on the platform produce data products and analyses useful to governments, non-partisan policy groups, and academic researchers.

We acquire novel data sources; turn raw data into usable data by cultivating collaborative processing and featurization; and finally, offer new data to researchers, policymakers, media, and the public at large. You can find a full list of our current products here .

## This Repository

This repo serves as a public-facing space for us to share introductory materials with prospective volunteers and anybody else who is curious about what we do. We have shared two notebooks. 
-  A [ "Getting Started" notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/center-for-new-data/introductory-materials/blob/main/notebooks/Introduction.ipynb?flush_cache=true) which describes some of the Center for New Data's technology stack and how we interact with it.
-  A [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/center-for-new-data/introductory-materials/blob/main/notebooks/ElectoralFairness.ipynb?flush_cache=true) walking through a [dataset](https://github.com/center-for-new-data/introductory-materials/blob/main/data/percent-waiting-over-thirty-minutes-ga-early-vote.csv) produced by Center for New Data researchers. The notebook assesses the impact of poll closures in the run up to the 2021 Georgia Senate runoff election.

We hope you find these notebooks interesting and educational. If you would like to apply to volunteer with the Center for New Data, applications are available <a href="https://www.newdata.org/volunteer">here</a>.
